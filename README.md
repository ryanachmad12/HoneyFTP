# HoneyFTP   
*A simple honeypot for FTP brute-force detection.*

HoneyFTP is a fake FTP service written in Python that mimics a real FTP server, designed to detect suspicious login attempts, including brute-force attacks and common exploit patterns.  
This project is intended for **educational** and **research** purposes in a controlled environment only.

---

##  Features

- Fake FTP server listening on port 21
- Realistic banner to trick scanners and bots
- Logs:
  - Successful and failed login attempts
  - Brute-force detection (more than 4 login attempts per IP per second)
- Threaded connection handling
- Easy to configure and extend

---

##  How It Works

HoneyFTP listens on port `21` and accepts any incoming connection.  
It simulates responses like a real FTP server but never gives real access.  
If an IP attempts to login repeatedly (e.g. >4 times per second), it is flagged as a brute-force attempt.

Logs are saved in `logs/honeylogs.log` in a structured format with timestamps.

##  Directory Structure

```bash
HoneyFTP/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py              # Main honeypot server
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ honeylogs.log    # Log file (auto-created)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            
````

---

##  Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Works out of the box (no 3rd-party dependencies)

---

##  Usage

### Run the FTP honeypot:

```bash
sudo python3 main.py
```

> Make sure port 21 is not in use by a real FTP service (like vsftpd, proftpd, etc.)

---

## Brute-force Simulation Tool

A simple script is included to simulate brute-force login attempts.

```bash
python3 bruteforce.py
```

It sends multiple random `USER`/`PASS` attempts to `127.0.0.1:21` using 4 threads.
